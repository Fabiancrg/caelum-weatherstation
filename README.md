## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### **Rain Gauge Not Detecting**
- **ESP32-H2**: Verify GPIO12 connections and reed switch operation
- **ESP32-C6**: Verify GPIO5 connections and reed switch operation
- Check that device is connected to Zigbee network (rain gauge only active when connected)
- Ensure proper pull-down resistor on rain gauge input
- Both targets support rain detection during deep sleep

#### **BME280 Not Reading**  
- **ESP32-H2**: Check I2C connections (SDA: GPIO10, SCL: GPIO11)
- **ESP32-C6**: Check I2C connections (SDA: GPIO6, SCL: GPIO7)
- Verify BME280 I2C address (default: 0x76 or 0x77)
- Ensure proper power supply to sensor (3.3V)

#### **Zigbee Connection Issues**
- Perform factory reset with long press (5s) on built-in button
- Ensure Zigbee coordinator is in pairing mode
- Check channel compatibility between coordinator and device
- **Auto-retry**: Device automatically retries every 30 seconds when disconnected
- **Extended wake time**: Device now stays awake for 60 seconds (instead of 10s) during join attempts
- **Battery impact**: Extended connection attempts may drain battery faster
- **Join timing**: Allow full 60 seconds for device to complete Zigbee join process

#### **Device Not Waking from Sleep**
- Check battery voltage (minimum 3.0V recommended)
- Verify wake-up sources (timer, rain gauge)
- Review sleep manager logs for errors
- **Network dependency**: Device stays awake longer when not connected to network

#### **High Battery Drain**
- Check if device is stuck in connection retry mode (30-second intervals)
- Verify Zigbee network is stable and accessible
- Monitor connection retry count in device logs
- Consider factory reset if connection issues persist

### 📋 Development Notes

- **ESP-IDF Version**: v5.5.1 recommended
- **Zigbee SDK**: Latest ESP Zigbee SDK required  
- **Memory Usage**: ~2MB flash, ~200KB RAM typical
- **Power Consumption**: ~100mA active, 7-10µA in deep sleep
- **Battery Operation**: Optimized for CR123A or Li-ion battery packs
- **Target Support**: Both ESP32-H2 and ESP32-C6 fully support RTC GPIO wake-up for rain detection
