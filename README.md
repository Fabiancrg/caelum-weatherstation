## Project Description

This project implements a battery-powered environmental monitoring device using ESP32-C6/H2 with Zigbee connectivity. The device features a 3-endpoint design with remote sleep configuration, optimized for low-power operation with deep sleep support and extended wake time during network join.

This project is based on the examples provided in the ESP Zigbee SDK:

* [ESP Zigbee SDK Docs](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-zigbee-sdk)
* [ESP Zigbee SDK Repo](https://github.com/espressif/esp-zigbee-sdk)

## Device Features

### 🌐 Zigbee Endpoints Overview

| Endpoint | Device Type | Clusters | Description |
|----------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **1** | Environmental Sensor | Temperature, Humidity, Pressure, Battery, OTA | BME280 sensor via I2C |
| **2** | Rain Gauge | Analog Input | Tipping bucket rain sensor with rainfall totals |
| **3** | Sleep Configuration | Analog Input | Remote sleep duration control (60-7200 seconds) |
| **4** | LED Debug Control | On/Off | WS2812 RGB LED status indicator (remote control) |

### 💡 LED Debug Feature (Optional)

The device includes an optional WS2812 RGB LED on GPIO8 (ESP32-H2 SuperMini) that provides visual feedback:
- **Blue (Steady)**: Connected to Zigbee network
- **Orange (Blinking)**: Joining/searching for network  
- **White (Brief Flash)**: Rain pulse detected
- **Off**: Deep sleep or disabled via Zigbee

This feature can be controlled remotely via Zigbee2MQTT (endpoint 4) and disabled to conserve battery. See [LED_DEBUG_FEATURE.md](LED_DEBUG_FEATURE.md) for complete documentation.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### **Rain Gauge Not Detecting**
- **ESP32-H2**: Verify GPIO12 connections and reed switch operation
- **ESP32-C6**: Verify GPIO5 connections and reed switch operation
- Check that device is connected to Zigbee network (rain gauge only active when connected)
- Ensure proper pull-down resistor on rain gauge input
- Both targets support rain detection during deep sleep

#### **BME280 Not Reading**  
- **ESP32-H2**: Check I2C connections (SDA: GPIO10, SCL: GPIO11)
- **ESP32-C6**: Check I2C connections (SDA: GPIO6, SCL: GPIO7)
- Verify BME280 I2C address (default: 0x76 or 0x77)
- Ensure proper power supply to sensor (3.3V)

#### **Battery Monitoring Issues**
- Verify voltage divider connections (2x 100kΩ resistors to GPIO4)
- Check battery cell voltage tap (should be 2.7V-4.2V at divider output)
- Ensure GPIO4 (ADC1_CH4) is properly configured
- Monitor serial output for ADC calibration messages
- **ESP32-H2 ADC quirk**: Uses empirical correction factor (1.604x) for DB_12 attenuation
- Battery percentage calculated from voltage (2.7V=0%, 4.2V=100%)
- **Optimized reading schedule**: 
  - First reading always happens on boot/pairing
  - Subsequent readings every hour (3600 seconds) based on elapsed time
  - Uses NVS to persist timestamp across deep sleep cycles
  - Robust to frequent wake-ups (e.g., during rain events)

#### **Zigbee Connection Issues**
- Perform factory reset with long press (5s) on built-in button
- Ensure Zigbee coordinator is in pairing mode
- Check channel compatibility between coordinator and device
- **Auto-retry**: Device automatically retries every 30 seconds when disconnected
- **Extended wake time**: Device now stays awake for 60 seconds (instead of 10s) during join attempts
- **Battery impact**: Extended connection attempts may drain battery faster
- **Join timing**: Allow full 60 seconds for device to complete Zigbee join process

#### **Device Not Waking from Sleep**
- Check battery voltage (minimum 3.0V recommended)
- Verify wake-up sources (timer, rain gauge)
- Review sleep manager logs for errors
- **Network dependency**: Device stays awake longer when not connected to network

#### **High Battery Drain**
- Check if device is stuck in connection retry mode (30-second intervals)
- Verify Zigbee network is stable and accessible
- Monitor connection retry count in device logs
- Consider factory reset if connection issues persist
- **Battery monitoring optimization**: Should consume only ~12µAh/day (hourly readings)
- **Total optimized power**: ~230µAh/day → 10.9 year battery life (2500mAh battery)
- **LED Debug**: If enabled, LED consumes ~20mA during wake cycles (can be disabled via Zigbee)

#### **LED Not Working**
- **ESP32-H2 SuperMini**: Verify GPIO8 connection to WS2812 RGB LED
- Check LED debug feature is enabled in `esp_zb_weather.h` (`DEBUG_LED_ENABLE=1`)
- Verify LED debug is enabled via Zigbee2MQTT switch (endpoint 4)
- Monitor serial output for LED initialization messages
- Ensure led_strip component (~2.0.0) is properly installed
- **LED States**: Blue=connected, Orange blink=joining, White flash=rain, Off=sleep/disabled
- See [LED_DEBUG_FEATURE.md](LED_DEBUG_FEATURE.md) for detailed troubleshooting
